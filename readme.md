# Animated Vector Graphics
Everyone likes SVGs. They're compact and infinitely scalable. Did you know, that you can animate them and even make them interactive, using a JavaScript library called GSAP? Well, you can, and it's easy. The code can even be written inside the SVG-file itself.

Simply create the svg in inkscape, illustrator, or other vector-drawing software. Open the file in a text-editor and add your code.

Open these two examples (Tested with Chrome) and check out the results.

[A starry night](night.svg).
![Starry Night](night.svg)

[A tree, waving in the wind](tree.svg).
![Waving Tree](tree.svg)

Or open the raw files to check out the code.
